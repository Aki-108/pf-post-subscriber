# pf-post-subscriber
Subscribe a post and get notifications for new comments.

## installation
1. If you don't already have it, you'll need to install the browser extension Tampermonkey (or a similar one).
2. Click on the Tampermonkey icon in the top right of your browser and choose to create a new userscript.
3. Delete everything in the new script and past everything from the pf-lightbox main.js file.
4. Save with Ctrl+S or through the menus.

Note: This extention only loads reliably when the tab is focused. Opening a tab in the background won't work.

Tested on Firefox for Windows 10.
